# Day 2 – Object-Oriented Programming in Java
Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm centered around objects — reusable instances of classes that contain data (fields) and behavior (methods).

## What I Learned

### Pillars of OOP:
1. **Encapsulation** – Group related data & behavior; Hiding internal state using private fields & public getters/setters
2. **Inheritance** – Extending base classes to reuse code
3. **Abstraction** – Expose only essential features; Hiding complexity via abstract classes or interfaces
4. **Polymorphism** – Same interface, multiple implementations (e.g., method overriding)

## Code Files:
- `Encapsulation.java`: Demonstrates Encapsulation
- `Inheritance.java`: Demonstrates Inheritance and Method Overriding
- `Abstraction.java`: Demonstrates Abstract Classes
- `Polymorphism.java`: Demonstrates runtime polymorphism


## 	Q: What’s the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?
    **A: Encapsulation hides the data, abstraction hides the implementation.
##	Q: Can Java support multiple inheritance?
    **A: Not with classes, but yes using interfaces.
##	Q: When to use abstract class vs interface?
	•	Use interface when no implementation is needed.
	•	Use abstract class when some methods can be implemented.

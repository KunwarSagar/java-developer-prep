## 1. What Does a FANG Java Developer Do?

FANG-level Java developers are typically responsible for:

- Building scalable back-end systems using **Java**, especially with **Spring Boot** and **microservices**
- Writing **clean, testable, and maintainable** code
- Designing and implementing **RESTful APIs**
- Applying **design patterns** and understanding **system architecture**
- Working with **distributed systems**, **caching**, **databases**, and **message queues**
- Contributing to **CI/CD pipelines** and debugging **performance bottlenecks**
- Participating in **code reviews** and writing **unit/integration tests**
